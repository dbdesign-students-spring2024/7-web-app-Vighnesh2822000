# My Web App

## Title
- My web app is called "Decentralised Banking Network".

## Description
- The "Decentralised Banking Network" is a fintech site similar to Venmo. But unlike traditional banking systems that depend on SWIFT, UPI and other communication systems, my app uses a peer to peer protocol to safely transfer money from one account to another. One can send and receive money from other DBN members for no transactional cost. As of now we only allow transaction in US Dollars. Other currencies will be rolled out pretty soon!
One can create a new DBN account, add money to your account and then transfer money from their DBN account to other DBN members. You can update certain aspects of your transactions- like changing the receivers name and message anytime you want. This gives you the option to hide your and the receiver's identity from others. On top of this you can completely delete the record of your transaction from the system and have no record of transactions. This feature gives my app a resemblence to the swiss banking system- outsiders can never known anything. 
And finally like venmo one can see all the transactions that happened between any two people- but not the amount they exchange.
